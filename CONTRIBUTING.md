Once you have found an issue, leave a comment indicating that you are working on it to avoid duplicate efforts. If no issue exists yet, create one to discuss what you want to implement.

## Getting Help
The best way to get help is:

* Asking on the issue you are working on
* Create an issue and lable it as question
* Create a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). You can add questions to specific [code lines](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) as comments.
